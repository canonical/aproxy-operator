# Aproxy operator
<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/charm/) deploying and managing the [aproxy snap](https://snapcraft.io/install/aproxy/ubuntu) as a subordinate machine charm.

The aproxy charm installs and configures the aproxy snap and applies nftables rules to transparently intercept outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic from a principal charm, forwarding it through an upstream proxy.

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, configuration, integration, scaling, and more. 
For aproxy, this includes:

- Installing and configuring the aproxy snap.

- Enforcing nftables rules to transparently redirect outbound traffic.

- Forwarding HTTP/HTTPS requests through a configurable upstream proxy.

- Supporting exclusions for specific destinations (`no-proxy`).

- Configurable interception ports (`intercept-ports`).

The aproxy charm is a subordinate and can be attached to any principal application to ensure its outbound traffic is transparently proxied. It runs on machines hosting the principal charm and is compatible with a wide range of Juju-managed environments.

This charm makes operating aproxy simple and straightforward for DevOps or SRE teams through Jujuâ€™s clean interface, ensuring consistent policy enforcement for egress traffic without requiring per-application configuration.
