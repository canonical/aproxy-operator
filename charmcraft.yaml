  The Aproxy subordinate charm installs and manages the aproxy snap to transparently
  intercept any per-unit TCP traffic and forward it to a target proxy, while preserving
  the original hostname.

  This charm is useful in environments that require transparent proxying for compliance,
  monitoring, or traffic redirection.
